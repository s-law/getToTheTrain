#Get To The Train! (GT3!)

##Minimize the time spent waiting on the platform for the next train.

What's worse than missing the train? Running to the platform, just to find out that you just missed the train and have to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next one.

GT3! will show you the closest train station and the times of departure for the next trains. On desktop, the times are color-coded according to your actual distance from the station:
  - Blue: Take it easy, you've got time!
  - Green: Make your exit.
  - Yellow: If you run, you'll have a minute or two to spare.
  - Red: Figure on taking the next train.

On mobile, the destination is colored according to the very next train: when you're on the go, that's all you need to know!
