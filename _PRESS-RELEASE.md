There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Project Name ##
  Get To The Train! (GT3!)

## Sub-Heading ##
  Wait less, go more

## Summary ##
  Minimize the time spent waiting on the platform for the next train.

## Problem ##
  What's worse than missing the train? Running to the platform, just to find out that you just missed the train and have to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next one.

## Solution ##
  GT3! will show you the closest train station and the times of departure for the next trains. On desktop, the times are color-coded according to your actual distance from the station:
  - Blue: Take it easy, you've got time!
  - Green: Make your exit.
  - Yellow: If you run, you'll have a minute or two to spare.
  - Red: Figure on taking the next train.

  On mobile, the destination is colored according to the very next train: when you're on the go, that's all you need to know!

## Quote from You ##
  "I'm not just the developer, I'm also a user!" -Steven Law

## How to Get Started ##
  Just launch GT3!--either from your browser or launching it from your home screen--and GT3! will be working for you!

## Customer Quote ##
  "After I started using 'Get To The Train', I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a late-night BART train!" - John Smith
